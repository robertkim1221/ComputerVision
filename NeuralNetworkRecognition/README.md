## Neural Network-Based Recognition

### Overview
This repository features Python implementations for neural network-based letter/writing recognition. It includes building and training a neural network from scratch and using it for text extraction from images as well as from using PyTorch framework.

### Contents
- Scripts for implementing and training neural networks.
Scripts for text extraction from images using the trained models.
- Additional resources and utilities for neural network implementation.

### Key Concepts
1. Neural Network Implementation: Building a fully connected network including network initialization, forward and backward propagation, and training loops.

2. Text Recognition: Training the network to recognize letters and digits from the NIST Special Database 19.

3. Extracting Text from Images: Using the trained network to identify and extract text from various images.

4. Experimentation with PyTorch: Implementing and comparing the performance of neural networks using PyTorch, including convolutional neural networks.

5. Real-world Application Scenarios: Analyzing the effectiveness of these models in practical, real-world scenarios.

### Applications
This repository is useful for students, educators, and researchers interested in practical applications of neural networks in text recognition and extraction from images.

### Future Updates
More detailed documentation, including usage instructions and additional notes on each script, will be provided in subsequent updates.
