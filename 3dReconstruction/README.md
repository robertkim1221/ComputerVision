## 3D Reconstruction

### Overview
This repository contains Python implementations and datasets for 3D reconstruction in computer vision. It covers a range of techniques from fundamental matrix estimation to bundle adjustment.

### Contents
- Scripts implementing various 3D reconstruction techniques.
- Test datasets for algorithm validation.

### Key Concepts
1. Fundamental Matrix Estimation: Implementing the Eight Point Algorithm for estimating the fundamental matrix from corresponding points in two images.

2. Metric Reconstruction: Using the essential matrix and triangulation to find and visualize 3D locations of corresponding image points.

3. 3D Visualization: Techniques to render 3D point clouds from image pairs.

4. Bundle Adjustment: Refining 3D coordinates and camera parameters to minimize reprojection error.

5. Multiview Keypoint Reconstruction: Using multi-view capture to reconstruct moving objects, like vehicles, in 3D.

### Applications
The repository is tailored for educational and research purposes in advanced computer vision, particularly for those interested in 3D reconstruction from 2D images.

### Future Updates
More detailed documentation, including descriptions for each script and usage instructions, will be added soon.
